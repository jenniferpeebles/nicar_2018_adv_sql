Advanced SQL for the 2018 NICAR conference in Chicago

Welcome! Let's do some SQL!

The data we'll be working with today is a slice of some data from OSHA regarding workplace safety and on-the-job accidents. That data set has a whole bunch of tables, but we'll only be working with three of them today to keep things simple. 

Thanks to Liz Lucas, formerly of NICAR, who has taught this class previously, for posting her code here on Github. [You can see her code here] (https://github.com/eklucas/NICAR-Adv-SQL).

Here's the [data dictionary for this data from OSHA] (http://enforcedata.dol.gov/views/data_dictionary.php).
